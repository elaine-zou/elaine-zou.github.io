<h4>about me</h4>

<p>I am a second-year student majoring in Data Science at Northeastern University! One of my personal passions that happens to also coincide with my academic pursuits is Formula One. 
  
Like many others, I was initially a Formula 1 skeptic. Although I knew of the sport and had friends who enjoyed it, I was unable to discern the appeal of watching 20 cars drive around in circles for two hours. Despite common belief, however, Formula 1 is much more complex and interesting as a sport. After becoming an avid fan, I realized that Formula 1 is akin to a chess match, albeit with many more players on the board.  Beyond simply driving fast, strategy is key to winning races, and thousands of make-or-break decisions are made throughout the course of each season. Data analytics have become the cornerstone of Formula 1 strategy and decision-making as technology has advanced. The importance of data science within the realm of Formula 1 cannot be overstated.</p>
